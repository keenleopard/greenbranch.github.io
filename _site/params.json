My name is Peng Zhou and I am a physics students. Over a long time I have been hoping for creating\r\na personal blog where I can put my physics, mathematical thoughts and computational practices. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the formula of decay of SW at small $$$\\omega$$$: \r\n$$\r\n\\text{Im} J(q) = -\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi} \\text{Tr}_L [p(\\varepsilon_F)\\text{Im} T^{\\uparrow}(k,\\varepsilon_F) p(\\varepsilon_F)\\text{Im} T^{\\downarrow}(k+q,\\varepsilon_F)]\r\n$$\r\n\r\nShould there be an integration over $$$k$$$, so this formula also become a convolution in $$$q$$$ space, as in the case of $$$J(q)$$$?\r\n$$\r\nJ(q)=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int dk \\int ^{\\varepsilon_F} dz ~\\text{Im}[pT^{\\uparrow}(k)pT^{\\downarrow}(k+q)]\r\n$$\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
