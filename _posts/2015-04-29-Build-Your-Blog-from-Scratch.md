# Build Your Blog from Scratch

In this blog I am going to list some sources that were highly useful when I built this blog. The process is very easy, and hopefully this will help you. 


### [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
The first thing you need when building a blog is somewhere to store your stuff. There are many ways to do this. If you are attending an university, it is very likely that your university offer virtual host for free. Alternatively, you can buy a place from one of the may commerical virtual hosts. But I would suggest the Github Pages for two things: 

1.	**It is totally free**. Github offers a free page for everyone, and I am sure the space available will beyond your need. There are many projects just use github to host their websites. So if you don't want to spend a hundred dollars on your bolg every year, github pages is just for you.
2.	**It is convenient**. The website built on github pages is just like a normal repository. So you can use git to manage it. You can clone it to your local device, commit every change you make and keep a full track of your modifications. This is unparalleled compared to building your blog elsewhere. 

###[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
Since we are building a blog rather than make a very fancy business website, the content is what we want to be more concentrated onto. And Jekyll is ths perfect tool for your: it has everything you need and nothing more. 

Jekyll in many ways is very similar to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). They are both tools to make your life much easier in the journey. As a matter of fact, when I built my first blog two years ago, I also used WordPress and it is indeed more versatile than its counterpart. But you may learn some PHP if you want to understand how WordPress works. Now I would recommend Jekyll because you only need to worry about the front-end appearance, which only takes a couple of hours to learn. 

Another big feature of Jekyll is the convenience. Once you have done the basic settings, you can totally focus on your contents for each posts. For example, [this file](/archive/2015-04-29-Build-Your-Blog-from-Scratch.md) is all I wrote for this post. Besides, if you use Jekyll together with Github Pages, you can work just on your local device without publishing it until you are satisfied. And Jekyll can build the website automatically as you are making changes!

###[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
You may wish to find some beautiful icons to be included in your website, and this website is just as it's name suggests: Awesome! The icons in the topright of my website are just implemented from Font Awesome. They are beautiful, Aren't they?

###[Andrew's tutorial to Jekyll](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial)
I found the documents on Jekyll's official website is not easily comprehensible. So I google some tutorials and found his one is great. In addition, Andrew's [personal blog](https://www.andrewmunsell.com) is stunning, can be regraded as a template to compare your website with. 

###[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
You may wish to pick a theme offered by Github Pages itself (and this is what I did right now), but bootstrap is a more (is not the most) popular framework to beautify your website.
