title: Decay Time of Spin Wave
---
As for the formula of decay of SW at small $$$\omega$$$: 
$$
\text{Im} J(q) = -\frac{\omega}{\pi} \text{Tr}_L [p(\varepsilon_F)\text{Im} T^{\uparrow}(k,\varepsilon_F) p(\varepsilon_F)\text{Im} T^{\downarrow}(k+q,\varepsilon_F)]
$$

Should there be an integration over $$$k$$$, so this formula also become a convolution in $$$q$$$ space, as in the case of $$$J(q)$$$?
$$
J(q)=\frac{1}{\pi} \int dk \int ^{\varepsilon_F} dz ~\text{Im}[pT^{\uparrow}(k)pT^{\downarrow}(k+q)]
$$
